### 何为 NSTC?

**Neural Sequential Tensor Completion (NSTC)** is a technique for **inferring missing data** in multidimensional arrays (tensors) by exploiting their **spatiotemporal correlations**. It uses a neural network to model the interactions among data features and learn **high-order patterns from local to global ranges**. NSTC can be applied to various domains such as network monitoring, video completion, and recommender systems.

Some topics:

- Network Monitoring: NSTC can accurately recover the **performance metrics** of a large network by measuring only a subset of paths or time intervals and exploiting their spatiotemporal correlations
- Visual Data(e.g. Video Completion):NSTC can enhance the quality of images or videos **by filling in the missing pixels or frames** using their low-rank structure and high-order interactions3
- Recommender Systerms: NSTC can provide **personalized recommendations** for users by predicting their preferences or ratings for items based on their historical behaviors and similarities with other users

###	为什么会有缺失值?

There are many possible causes of missing data in multidimensional arrays. Some of them are:

- **Data corruption**: 
  1. Data collection errors: Sometimes data may not be collected properly due to technical errors, system crashes, or connectivity issues. Not only **equipment malfunctions**, but also **human errors** are possible reason.
  2. Data processing errors: The collected data may undergo processing to remove outliers or to transform data to a more usable format. During this process, some data may be accidentally deleted or misplaced. (**Lost files**)

- **Intentional omission**: Data may be deliberately left out if it is deemed irrelevant or if it contains sensitive information, such as privacy concerns, avoiding negative perceptions, preventing spam or manipulation, or simply not relevant to business goals.
  - Some examples:
    - Website owners may intentionally omit tracking certain metrics such as bounce rate or time on page for certain pages that are not relevant to their business goals.
    - Social media metrics: Social media platforms may intentionally omit certain metrics such as the number of times a post has been shared or the total number of followers of a user, in order to prevent spam or manipulation.
    - Financial metrics: Companies may intentionally omit certain financial metrics such as debt-to-equity ratio or return on investment (ROI) to avoid negative perceptions from investors or stakeholders.

Missing data can affect the **quality and validity** of your analysis, so it is important to handle them properly. One way to do that is by using tensor completion methods such as NSTC (**This paragraph descibe the importance of NSTC**)
